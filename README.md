# Movie Mashup as a Book
MFA Design and Technology, Parsons The New School for Design

This project was the first experiment with generative narrative using movies. Using subtitle files (.srt), it mashes up the lines from [Her](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/) and [Weird Science](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090305/).
The idea is to play with the readers capability of buillding its own narrative â€” no matter how nonsense the text.

The resulting text was printed and binded as a book.

This project is the predecessor of the [Movie Mashup Tool](https://github.com/gianordoli/mashup_movie), developed for the same class.
