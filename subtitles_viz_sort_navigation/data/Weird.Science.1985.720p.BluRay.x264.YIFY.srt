1
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:32,884
This is so beautiful.

2
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:34,922
You know it, Gary.

3
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:38,561
Look at her.

4
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:48,671
Do you know
what I'd like to do?

5
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:50,872
Shower with them.

6
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,276
Then we hit
the city, baby,

7
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,177
dead on,

8
00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:58,310
for a little drinks,

9
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:00,306
a little nightlife,
dancing...

10
00:01:00,383 --> 00:01:01,211
Dancing.

11
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:04,922
<i>We throw a huge party,
I mean huge party...</i>

12
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,873
Everybody's invited,
women everywhere.

13
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:11,958
All these girls,
they're all there.

14
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:14,494
Naked bodies everywhere.

15
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:16,032
They'll know my name.

16
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:17,499
What?

17
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:19,833
Nobody likes us.
Nobody.

18
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:23,341
Why are you messing
with the fantasy?

19
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:26,004
We know about
the reality.

20
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,513
Don't ruin
the fantasy, okay?

21
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:30,016
And then,

22
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:32,018
we're a hit, man.

23
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:34,022
We're popular.
We're revered.

24
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,080
Man, we're studs.

25
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:41,556
When the smoke clears,
right...

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,330
those two dames

27
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:47,337
fall amazingly,
completely,

28
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,605
and totally in love
with us, Wyatt.

29
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,646
Check it out.

30
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,647
Yo!

31
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,947
Check us out!

32
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:19,236
Look, we're
sorry about...

33
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,550
<i>She's alive</i>

34
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:28,521
<i>She's alive</i>

35
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:29,614
<i>Weird science</i>

36
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:37,628
<i>Weird</i>

37
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:39,100
<i>Ooh</i>

38
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:45,774
<i>Weird science</i>

39
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:47,506
<i>Plastic tubes
and pots and pans</i>

40
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,706
<i>Bits and pieces</i>

41
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,250
<i>And magic from our hands</i>

42
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:52,819
<i>We're makin'
weird science</i>

43
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:55,254
<i>Ooh, things
I've never seen before</i>

44
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:56,550
<i>Behind bolted doors</i>

45
00:02:56,624 --> 00:03:00,221
<i>And imagine,
it's my creation</i>

46
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:01,854
<i>Is it real?</i>

47
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:03,899
<i>It's my creation</i>

48
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:05,730
<i>I do not know</i>

49
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,499
<i>No hesitations</i>

50
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:09,506
<i>Your heart of gold</i>

51
00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:11,234
<i>Is flesh and blood</i>

52
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:12,742
<i>I do not know</i>

53
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:13,869
<i>Why do I know?</i>

54
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,572
<i>From my heart
and from my hand</i>

55
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:17,514
<i>Why don't people
understand</i>

56
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:19,017
<i>My intentions</i>

57
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:23,751
<i>Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
weird science</i>

58
00:03:23,857 --> 00:03:25,486
<i>Ooh</i>

59
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,051
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

60
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:30,558
<i>Weird science</i>

61
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:33,530
<i>Things I've never
seen before</i>

62
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,071
<i>Behind bolted doors</i>

63
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,040
<i>Weird science</i>

64
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,940
<i>Bits and pieces
and bits and pieces</i>

65
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,206
<i>And bits and pieces</i>

66
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:42,608
<i>Science</i>

67
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:45,751
<i>Weird</i>

68
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:51,289
Where did your
parents go, anyway?

69
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:52,569
Cincinnati.

70
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:55,746
They're meeting the guy
my sister wants to marry.

71
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,396
Chloe? Who the hell
would marry Chloe?

72
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,977
He's studying
to be a vet.

73
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,395
Don't make a mess.

74
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:06,661
The maid doesn't come
till Monday.

75
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:10,466
How come your parents
suddenly trust you?

76
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,163
Chet's coming home from
college for the weekend.

77
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:15,911
He's in charge.

78
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:18,657
Chet? Shit!

79
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:23,298
You should have
told me this

80
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:26,066
before I agreed
to sleep over.

81
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,397
How do you
put up with him?

82
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:30,190
If I don't, he beats
the shit out of me.

83
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,592
It's a habit he picked
up in military school.

84
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:36,715
He's very
protective of me.

85
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:38,781
Nice relationship.

86
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:44,416
<i>Look.!</i>

87
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,826
<i>There's nothing
to fear.</i>

88
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:48,385
<i>Look.</i>

89
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:50,930
<i>No blood, no decay.</i>

90
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:55,733
<i>Go on.
Fix the electrodes.</i>

91
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:57,689
<i>You'll have plenty
to be afraid of</i>

92
00:04:57,754 --> 00:04:59,402
<i>before
the night's over.</i>

93
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:01,592
<i>The storm
will be magnificent...</i>

94
00:05:01,663 --> 00:05:05,517
<i>All the electrical
secrets of heaven.</i>

95
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,305
<i>This time we're ready,
Fritz.</i>

96
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:10,048
<i>Let's have
one final test.</i>

97
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:12,398
<i>Throw the switches.</i>

98
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:17,006
<i>Here in this machine,</i>

99
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:19,369
<i>I have discovered
the great ray</i>

100
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:23,241
<i>that first brought life
into the world.</i>

101
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:26,246
<i>Here's
the final touch...</i>

102
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:30,658
<i>the brain
you stole, Fritz...</i>

103
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,485
<i>The brain of a dead man</i>

104
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,584
<i>waiting to live again
in a body I made.</i>

105
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,290
It's not a bad idea.

106
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:40,750
What?

107
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:42,791
<i>In 15 minutes,
the storm...</i>

108
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:44,889
Making a girl.

109
00:05:48,403 --> 00:05:50,395
Actually making a girl...

110
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:53,809
just like Frankenstein,

111
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:56,368
except cuter.

112
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:58,279
<i>Nobody must come here.!</i>

113
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,284
<i>Don't touch it.!</i>

114
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:01,786
<i>Sorry, Doctor.</i>

115
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:03,754
You're serious.

116
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,154
Yes.

117
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:09,795
Look me in the eyes.

118
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,799
Do I look serious?

119
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:13,298
<i>You're crazy.!</i>

120
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:14,837
<i>Crazy am I?</i>

121
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:16,302
<i>We'll see</i>

122
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:18,807
<i>whether I'm crazy or not.</i>

123
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,140
Gary Wallace,
that's absolutely gross.

124
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:25,205
I'm not digging up
dead girls.

125
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:31,991
I'm not talking about
digging up a dead girl.

126
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,959
I'm talking about
your computer, idiot.

127
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:40,121
You can simulate stuff
on your computer.

128
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:44,542
Why can't we
simulate a girl?

129
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:47,129
I guess I could,
but why?

130
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:49,082
It's two-dimensional
on the screen.

131
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:51,981
It's not
flesh and blood.

132
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:54,975
But we can
ask it questions.

133
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,716
We'll put it in
real-life sexual situations

134
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:57,597
and see how it reacts.

135
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:04,339
Well, what about
your girl in Canada?

136
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:06,063
She lives in Canada.

137
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,022
She has no morals.

138
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:10,951
I don't like that
in a girl.

139
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:12,803
Anyway, get to work.

140
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:19,545
Very nice.

141
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:27,613
Hold it, Wyatt.
I know female stats.

142
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:30,059
Anything bigger
than a handful,

143
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:32,502
you're risking
a sprained tongue.

144
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,023
Yeah.
Yeah.

145
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:37,965
Perfect.

146
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:39,925
Okay. Now what?

147
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,209
Should we give her
a brain?

148
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:45,742
Yeah. We'll play chess
with her.

149
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:49,344
Chess? Just give her
a brain.

150
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,698
That's all we can do
with my stuff.

151
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:09,074
Did you get a free
toaster with this, too?

152
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:12,728
The problem is,
this is a lame idea.

153
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:14,430
Your computer
is a wimp.

154
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,016
We need
a lot more power.

155
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,393
What do you suggest?

156
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:15,708
We're in.

157
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,133
We're in trouble, Gary.

158
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:20,635
This is highly illegal.

159
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:23,574
We got to fill this thing with data.

160
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:26,468
We'll make her
as real as possible.

161
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,707
I want her
to live, breathe.

162
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,467
I want her
to aerobicize.

163
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:08,425
<i>Live.!
All Dave, all night.!</i>

164
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:10,757
<i>We know what you need</i>

165
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:15,163
<i>only right here
on Dave TV!</i>

166
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:18,203
It's moving,
it's working.

167
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:20,262
It's working
by itself.

168
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:36,621
<i>I lo mee li I lo la la mala kroo</i>

169
00:10:36,694 --> 00:10:39,755
<i>kara kara chal
do le mo le lo...</i>

170
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:41,331
But, Gary...

171
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,575
by the way,

172
00:10:45,642 --> 00:10:48,956
why are we wearing
bras on our heads?

173
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:50,245
Ceremonial.

174
00:10:58,806 --> 00:10:59,443
You ready?

175
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:00,316
Yeah.

176
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,717
Let's go.

177
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:06,439
Turn it off!

178
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,265
<i>It is off!</i>

179
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,708
Hang up the phone!

180
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:26,006
Wyatt,
what's going on?

181
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:27,574
I don't know!

182
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:28,708
Unplug it!

183
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:35,661
Oh, shit!

184
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:42,097
Arf! Arf!

185
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:50,436
No!
It's a birthday present!

186
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,542
Oh, shit!

187
00:11:58,257 --> 00:11:59,666
Oh, shit!

188
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:03,005
Let's get this thing
out of your house!

189
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:04,708
You get it out!

190
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:07,462
This is
all your fault!

191
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,786
I'll get it out!

192
00:12:33,116 --> 00:12:35,801
Whoa!
What the hell is it?

193
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:38,320
Oh, shit!

194
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:11,228
One, two, three.

195
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:17,237
<i>She's alive. Alive.!</i>

196
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:20,049
Uhhhhh.

197
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,399
So what would you little
maniacs like to do first?

198
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,253
You guys created me.

199
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,326
I didn't come
from anywhere.

200
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:40,600
Before you messed around
with your computer,

201
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:43,690
I didn't even exist.

202
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:47,696
By the way,
you did an excellent job.

203
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:49,255
Thank you.

204
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:55,228
Hello?

205
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:00,569
Isn't showering real fun?

206
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:10,150
If we're going to have
fun together,

207
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,217
you guys
had better loosen up.

208
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:22,662
What're we gonna
do with her?

209
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,676
We'll just go
with the situation.

210
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:28,645
By Sunday, you'll
think of something.

211
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:31,149
You're
a very bright guy.

212
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:33,186
I'm just
being practical.

213
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,689
I know.
I appreciate it.

214
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:37,189
Let's go.

215
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:39,192
What about
this mess?

216
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,195
Clean it up
tomorrow.

217
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:45,199
Okay, but don't get
B.O. on Chet's suit,

218
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,259
or he'd kill me.

219
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:51,207
Where are we going?

220
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,210
We're going
downtown and...

221
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,714
Oh, my God!
Whose stuff is this?

222
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:58,307
Is that yours?

223
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:00,285
Gary, I don't know...

224
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:02,845
What is
going on here?

225
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:06,587
I don't know!
You look good, though, okay?

226
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:15,628
Did you steal
this car?

227
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,037
No.

228
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:19,338
How did you get it?

229
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:22,347
I can get
anything I want.

230
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:25,350
Right now,
I want to party.

231
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:26,510
Party?

232
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:29,521
Yeah. Think up
a name for me.

233
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,024
What name
do you want?

234
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:33,856
You think of one.

235
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:35,419
Lisa.

236
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:36,931
Why Lisa?

237
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:38,431
Why not?

238
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:42,403
He used to like
a girl named Lisa.

239
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:45,135
Oh, yeah?
Old girlfriend?

240
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:48,178
She kicked him
in the nuts.

241
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:50,180
Will you shut up?

242
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:52,183
It wasn't
your fault.

243
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,186
All you said was
hello to her.

244
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,688
Shut up!

245
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:58,748
Guys, I like Lisa.

246
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,818
That'll do just fine.

247
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:06,266
You guys
ready to rock?

248
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:07,962
Ready.
Ready.

249
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,561
Lisa?

250
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:34,967
Yeah?

251
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,666
I don't think
we belong here.

252
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:39,675
Don't be silly.

253
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:41,711
It's a public place.

254
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:46,647
We'd both
love to stay,

255
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:48,686
but we're not 21.

256
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:52,349
You're 21.

257
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:58,525
Maybe you'd feel better
if you mingled.

258
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,830
We don't mingle, okay?

259
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:04,841
Then we'll invite these people
to your house

260
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:07,843
and we could all
mingle there.

261
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:09,846
We'll mingle.
We'll mingle.

262
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:16,820
Hi, dudes.

263
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:30,663
Well, goddamn!

264
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,408
Listening to
this blues music

265
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:37,914
reminds me of my own
trials and tribulations

266
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:40,076
as a young guy.

267
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:42,985
My folks
really dump on me.

268
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:46,389
You guys get along
with your parents?

269
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:52,856
I guess you guys
moved out by now.

270
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:57,605
Uh, what's this, sir?

271
00:17:57,673 --> 00:17:59,105
Drink it.

272
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:04,943
That's a very
sweet thought,

273
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:07,006
but I really don't...

274
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,482
Until now.

275
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:18,397
See you guys
in the emergency room.

276
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:19,797
Pretty lady,

277
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:22,632
what's a beautiful broad
like you...

278
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:25,571
doing with a malaca
like this?

279
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:27,576
It's purely sexual.

280
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:30,446
No shit.

281
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:32,982
She's into
malacas, Dino.

282
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,714
Ha ha ha ha ha!

283
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:38,222
She's into malacas!

284
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,691
Do you believe that?

285
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,092
Ha ha ha ha ha!

286
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:47,323
You can
say that again!

287
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,986
Fats, man, let me tell you
my story, man.

288
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:10,495
Last year,

289
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:15,001
I was insane for this
crazy little 8th-grade bitch.

290
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:16,662
Crazy insane?

291
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,763
Insane?
Crazy?

292
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,368
I was nuts
for the woman, man.

293
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:25,677
I'm tellin'
the truth here.

294
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,650
I was nuts for the girl.

295
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:31,314
She had big titties.

296
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:35,486
She wouldn't have had
to worry about no titties

297
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:39,463
for the rest of her life.

298
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:41,159
That's the truth.

299
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:45,433
I called her every night
for like a month.

300
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:47,168
Every damn night?

301
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:49,176
Every night, Mitch.

302
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:51,543
<i>On the telephone?</i>

303
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:55,517
What's this boy talkin'
about, on the telephone?

304
00:19:55,586 --> 00:19:57,554
Explain it
to him.

305
00:19:57,621 --> 00:20:00,022
We know
there's a telephone.

306
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:03,528
But he hung up
on her.

307
00:20:03,596 --> 00:20:06,565
The chick with
those big titties?

308
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:11,300
You know what
the bitch did to me?

309
00:20:11,406 --> 00:20:13,340
Lay it on me.

310
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:14,841
Listen...

311
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,845
She kneed you
in the nuts.

312
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:19,882
She did what?

313
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:21,883
Bitch kneed your nuts?

314
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:23,885
Bitch kneed my nuts!

315
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:26,354
In the family
jewels?

316
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:28,916
<i>In the family jewels, man.</i>

317
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,087
Broke my heart in two.

318
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,065
She broke more
than your heart.

319
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,102
<i>Forget
that other one.</i>

320
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:40,105
You got this fine jewel sitting by you.

321
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:42,905
Ain't that the truth,
baby?

322
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:44,946
That's the plain truth!

323
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:50,482
Party's over.

324
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:52,489
Party's over,
says the girl.

325
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:54,616
Here's money for you...

326
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,627
$50 for you,
$50 for you.

327
00:20:57,695 --> 00:21:02,567
I'll bet $5 that boy won't
make it through the club.

328
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:07,039
Woo, baby

329
00:21:07,108 --> 00:21:08,598
You know I love you

330
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:15,540
I really shouldn't
be driving.

331
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,586
Listen,
I appreciate it.

332
00:21:17,654 --> 00:21:20,089
I don't feel
like driving.

333
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:22,091
Okay, forget it.

334
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,593
I'll drive.

335
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,595
Give me the keys!

336
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:28,099
Will he
be all right?

337
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:32,002
I warned him about
that blind dog bourbon.

338
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:34,506
He don't have
a license.

339
00:21:34,574 --> 00:21:38,136
I don't even have
a learner's permit.

340
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:41,011
Hey, let's scout
another party, man.

341
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:44,086
What will you
tell Chet about me?

342
00:21:44,154 --> 00:21:45,622
Nothing.

343
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:47,121
Nothing?

344
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,659
That's not very
realistic, Wyatt.

345
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,698
I'm just trying to
concentrate on the road.

346
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:55,199
Concentrate harder.

347
00:21:55,268 --> 00:21:57,828
You're running
a red light.

348
00:21:57,904 --> 00:21:59,428
Oh, shit!

349
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:10,981
I hate that stuff!
I never listen to it!

350
00:22:11,054 --> 00:22:13,214
I hate this car!

351
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:15,224
Are you okay?

352
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:18,728
My nuts
are halfway up my ass.

353
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,526
Other than that,
I'm perfect.

354
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:25,069
Think of what
you'll do about Chet.

355
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,539
He's one serious idiot.

356
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,637
You're stewed, butt-wad!

357
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:32,811
Who, me?

358
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,815
Know what time it is?

359
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:37,182
Uh, 2:00?

360
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:39,743
Time to pay the fiddler.

361
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:48,329
I was kind of
counting on you

362
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:50,901
to be human about this.

363
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:58,376
Here's the
bottom line, Wyatt.

364
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:01,314
I'm telling Mom and Dad
everything.

365
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:05,582
And I'm even considering
making up some shit.

366
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:11,327
All right, Chet.
Name your price.

367
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:13,829
$175 and zero cents,
cash...

368
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:16,331
New bills,
crisp and clean,

369
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,893
in my wallet by 7 A.M.

370
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:21,806
Thank you.

371
00:23:21,874 --> 00:23:25,332
Hey, what are
big brothers for?

372
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:27,540
See you upstairs.

373
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,884
How to be jilted.

374
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,855
Pllllttt.

375
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:37,859
Shh.

376
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:40,362
The boozehounds return.

377
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:42,865
What a joke!

378
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:44,424
Hi, girls.

379
00:23:55,749 --> 00:23:58,150
<i>Feeling kind of queasy?</i>

380
00:23:58,253 --> 00:24:03,783
How about a nice
greasy pork sandwich

381
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:06,863
served in
a dirty ashtray?

382
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:20,345
He pukes, you die.

383
00:24:20,413 --> 00:24:23,577
He's not laughing
at you, Chet.

384
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:25,710
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

385
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:30,349
Did you tell Chet about
the woman we made tonight?

386
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,791
He's drunk.

387
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:33,055
No shit.

388
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:35,461
No shit, Chet.

389
00:24:35,566 --> 00:24:39,059
You donkey dicks couldn't
get laid in a morgue.

390
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,104
You're absolutely right.

391
00:24:41,172 --> 00:24:43,106
You're absolutely
right, Chet.

392
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:44,608
Hey, Gary.

393
00:24:44,677 --> 00:24:46,235
What?

394
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:57,050
Ha ha ha ha!

395
00:24:57,126 --> 00:24:59,095
He's an asshole.

396
00:24:59,162 --> 00:25:00,959
Look at his haircut.

397
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,660
Anybody with
a haircut like that

398
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,669
<i>is an asshole.</i>

399
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:24,917
Psst. Lisa.

400
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,092
Where are you?

401
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:33,570
I'm right behind you.

402
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:39,407
Surprise!

403
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:48,554
I won't hurt you.

404
00:25:48,622 --> 00:25:52,560
Your lips feel like
rigor mortis has set in.

405
00:25:52,627 --> 00:25:54,561
Relax a little bit.

406
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:58,066
I wasn't expecting you
to kiss me.

407
00:25:58,134 --> 00:26:00,502
I mean, I was just...

408
00:26:00,572 --> 00:26:02,163
I was... uh...

409
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:09,546
<i>Oh</i>

410
00:26:12,752 --> 00:26:15,243
That was better.

411
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:18,087
Want to try it again?

412
00:26:18,193 --> 00:26:20,126
If you don't mind.

413
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:23,358
I mean,
yes, please, ma'am.

414
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:25,197
<i>Oh oh oh oh</i>

415
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:33,507
<i>Oh</i>

416
00:26:33,578 --> 00:26:35,206
Mmph!

417
00:26:41,388 --> 00:26:43,914
You sure
you're only 15?

418
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:46,517
I'll be 16 in June.

419
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:50,164
You made me.

420
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:52,201
You control me.

421
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,109
What are you
thinking about, huh?

422
00:27:00,178 --> 00:27:01,839
Um...

423
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,671
women's gymnastics.

424
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:08,120
Well, I don't know.

425
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:10,122
I'll do my best.

426
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,680
Good.

427
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:46,229
Oh.

428
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:51,866
Wyatt, Wyatt,

429
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:53,637
Wyatt, where are you?

430
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,679
I'm right here, Gary.

431
00:27:55,746 --> 00:27:57,179
What happened?

432
00:27:57,247 --> 00:27:59,114
I don't know.

433
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:02,621
I think
it was a dream.

434
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,384
What?

435
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:06,391
Everything...
Last night, Lisa.

436
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:09,123
It had to be a dream.

437
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:11,462
<i>We were both in it.</i>

438
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:15,401
Two people can't have
the same dream.

439
00:28:15,471 --> 00:28:18,305
It had to be a dream.

440
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:20,173
<i>In your dream,</i>

441
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:25,148
did I get up in the middle of the night

442
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:27,777
<i>and yak
in your sink?</i>

443
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:29,821
<i>Didn't throw up. No.</i>

444
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:33,326
Maybe it was a dream,
you know...

445
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:35,328
A very weird, bizarre,

446
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:42,270
<i>vivid, erotic, wet,
detailed dream.</i>

447
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:45,433
Maybe we have malaria.

448
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:46,908
Shit.

449
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:57,079
Gary! Wyatt!

450
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,647
<i>Breakfast.!</i>

451
00:29:02,062 --> 00:29:04,293
I don't
have the bucks

452
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:07,699
to pay Chet off
about this.

453
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:10,670
You can't fear Chet
the rest of your life.

454
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:13,265
Why not?
Please...

455
00:29:13,342 --> 00:29:15,675
I don't know, Wyatt.

456
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:20,309
I mean, it's seriously
affecting your sex life.

457
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:23,321
<i>10 seconds into
my gymnastics routine,</i>

458
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:25,323
<i>you passed out.</i>

459
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:26,790
You slept.

460
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:28,384
I did my toes.

461
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:31,295
By the way,
you're very cute.

462
00:29:31,364 --> 00:29:33,856
We'll try it again
sometime.

463
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:39,431
Good morning,
turd brain.

464
00:29:39,508 --> 00:29:40,977
Hi, Chet.

465
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,407
You spit in this?

466
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,478
Not that
I'm aware of, no.

467
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,423
Hey, that looks
pretty good.

468
00:29:58,433 --> 00:30:01,891
Now make yourself one,
dick weed.

469
00:30:08,444 --> 00:30:10,879
I like your panties.

470
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:14,543
It's a joke, Chet.

471
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,382
That's not a joke!

472
00:30:16,454 --> 00:30:19,390
That is a severe
behavioural disorder.

473
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,221
Those are women's
underpants!

474
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:25,390
Next you'll be wearing
a bra on your head.

475
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:29,402
The old man's
going to have a stroke.

476
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,906
All right, Chet.
How much?

477
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:33,373
How much?

478
00:30:33,442 --> 00:30:36,934
This goes way beyond
payment, pal.

479
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:38,946
Come on, Chet.
Please?

480
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:41,941
Well...

481
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:46,923
your VCR
should cover it...

482
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:48,425
for openers.

483
00:30:48,494 --> 00:30:49,928
Thank you.

484
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:53,989
For Christ's sakes,
will you cover yourself?

485
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:18,897
You guys looking for
something for your mom?

486
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:22,903
I really don't
think so... Sue.

487
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:27,340
Do you guys have,
uh... girlfriends?

488
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:32,347
One does not refer to
a 23-year-old woman

489
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:34,144
as a girlfriend.

490
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:36,117
Uh, mistress, Gar.

491
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,813
Um, lover.

492
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:39,116
Sexpot.

493
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,091
She's a sexpot.

494
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,095
<i>You guys are the ones that got beat up</i>

495
00:31:45,163 --> 00:31:47,654
at the homecoming
game, right?

496
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:53,640
Do you think
you could wrap up

497
00:31:53,707 --> 00:31:56,940
a bottle of
this scent for me?

498
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:58,344
<i>Um, two.</i>

499
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:01,578
Set yourself up
with one, too.

500
00:32:01,651 --> 00:32:04,176
Three scents, please.

501
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:08,089
If you were
a 15-year-old boy,

502
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,593
would these
turn you on?

503
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,122
I think so, too.
I'll take them.

504
00:32:20,674 --> 00:32:24,612
Do you have a bra
to match that...

505
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,616
something leather,
rubber, or barbed wire?

506
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:29,674
Give me a break.

507
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:34,123
Check it out.

508
00:32:34,191 --> 00:32:35,523
What?

509
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,632
Five bucks?

510
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:43,191
Finsky.

511
00:32:45,905 --> 00:32:48,205
Max, what
will you do?

512
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:54,678
For the first time
in my life,

513
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:58,187
I don't feel like
a total dick.

514
00:32:58,254 --> 00:32:59,983
Yeah, me either.

515
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:04,685
Ha ha ha ha ha!

516
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,033
<i>Ha ha ha ha.!</i>

517
00:33:12,104 --> 00:33:13,801
Sorry, boys.

518
00:33:13,874 --> 00:33:16,138
Momentary loss
of motor control.

519
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,146
<i>You guys getting
tired of this?</i>

520
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:22,116
There's a big
white sale going on...

521
00:33:22,184 --> 00:33:24,118
at Towel World!

522
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:26,451
We're not impressed.

523
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,689
Can I have some
of that, please?

524
00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:39,638
Their shit bores me.

525
00:33:39,706 --> 00:33:41,264
Should we dump them?

526
00:33:41,341 --> 00:33:44,277
We've been with them
three months.

527
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:47,281
We've been
to all the parties.

528
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:50,284
We won't go
to any more parties.

529
00:33:50,352 --> 00:33:53,288
We'll go into
a social coma.

530
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,755
Sorry.
Sorry.

531
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,293
Let's give them
another chance.

532
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,295
Okay.

533
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:01,195
Will you
forgive us?

534
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:03,199
Oh, you guys.

535
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:06,271
What will
we do with you?

536
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:41,274
Excuse me!

537
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:44,318
We got her,
we got her.

538
00:34:55,366 --> 00:34:56,857
Hey!

539
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:04,204
Hey.

540
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,778
Hi.

541
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,214
That's Ian.

542
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,250
This is Max.

543
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,686
We call him Mad Max.

544
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:16,623
<i>I saw you
on the escalator.</i>

545
00:35:16,692 --> 00:35:21,188
You were looking
at us, right?

546
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:22,460
Yeah.

547
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:30,108
So what
are you doing?

548
00:35:30,177 --> 00:35:31,405
Nothing.

549
00:35:31,478 --> 00:35:33,878
I'm waiting
for my ride.

550
00:35:46,597 --> 00:35:48,030
<i>Lis,</i>

551
00:35:48,098 --> 00:35:50,328
come on, hon.
We're late.

552
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:52,426
<i>Honey, move.</i>

553
00:35:52,503 --> 00:35:54,494
Speak
to you later.

554
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:07,354
She likes the rough stuff.

555
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:09,413
What can I do?

556
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:16,362
There's a party tonight
at Wyatt's house.

557
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:20,403
You can find his name
in the students' directory

558
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:21,905
<i>under Donnely.</i>

559
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:23,771
<i>Pass the word around.</i>

560
00:36:28,347 --> 00:36:29,475
Party?

561
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:38,654
Don't ask.

562
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:45,393
You'll have a heart attack
by the time you're 40.

563
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:47,438
Learn to relax.

564
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,940
Have you tried
inversion boots?

565
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:52,943
Lisa, you don't
understand my parents.

566
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,947
What's there
to understand?

567
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:56,949
They're oppressive,
meddlesome,

568
00:36:57,017 --> 00:36:59,452
difficult, demanding,
and totally bizarre.

569
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,384
They're normal parents.

570
00:37:01,454 --> 00:37:03,390
Go get dressed.

571
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,392
Lisa, I created you.

572
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,396
Why do you do things
I don't want?

573
00:37:09,464 --> 00:37:11,900
You and Gary want friends,

574
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:13,869
you want popularity,

575
00:37:13,937 --> 00:37:16,873
you want
all that stuff, right?

576
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:19,876
I thought about it.
Sure, but...

577
00:37:19,944 --> 00:37:22,937
So I'm
giving it to you.

578
00:37:23,582 --> 00:37:25,107
Thank you,

579
00:37:25,218 --> 00:37:29,656
but I don't want it
in my house.

580
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:31,691
If you want to be
a party animal,

581
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:35,490
learn to live
in the jungle.

582
00:37:35,563 --> 00:37:37,829
<i>Now go get dressed.</i>

583
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:39,562
I'll pick up Gary.

584
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:42,629
I can't wait
to meet his parents.

585
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:52,140
Do you go
to Gary's school?

586
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:55,744
Do I look like
I'm in high school?

587
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,050
No.

588
00:37:57,157 --> 00:37:59,592
<i>She's a foreign
exchange student.</i>

589
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:03,029
They have a different
educational system

590
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:05,431
<i>happening
around the world.</i>

591
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:08,198
You look very...

592
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:09,898
mature.

593
00:38:09,973 --> 00:38:11,407
Doesn't she?

594
00:38:11,476 --> 00:38:14,411
I was thinking
the same thing.

595
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:18,211
What do you do
for a living, Al?

596
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:20,514
I'm an independent
businessman.

597
00:38:20,587 --> 00:38:23,751
<i>My dad's a plumber.
He's into plumbing.</i>

598
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:27,590
I guess you plumb,
right, Dad?

599
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:30,428
Yeah.

600
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:33,435
I think
it's time to go.

601
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:34,970
You ready?

602
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:36,664
Where are you going?

603
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,573
To a party.
To a movie.

604
00:38:39,643 --> 00:38:42,875
Movie party,
is what it is.

605
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:45,883
No. I've whipped up
this nasty soiree

606
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:48,351
at his friend
Wyatt's house.

607
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:49,582
Soir what?

608
00:38:49,656 --> 00:38:51,089
Soiree, honey.

609
00:38:51,158 --> 00:38:53,559
I think
that means party.

610
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:54,890
Party.

611
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:59,059
There's going to be
sex, drugs, rock n' roll,

612
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:00,999
<i>chips, dips, chains, whips...</i>

613
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:04,062
<i>Your basic high school orgy.</i>

614
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,577
I'm not talking
candle wax on the nipples...

615
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,669
<i>Just hundreds of kids</i>

616
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,276
<i>running around in their underwear
acting like animals.</i>

617
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,116
I've heard enough!

618
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:18,988
Gary, get to your room!

619
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,618
Yes, sir!

620
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:23,255
It's okay.
I'll handle this.

621
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:26,732
Girlie, get out
before I throw you out.

622
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,600
Don't threaten me, Al!

623
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:30,605
You're out of shape.

624
00:39:30,673 --> 00:39:32,608
I'll kick your ass.

625
00:39:32,676 --> 00:39:36,637
<i>I'm going to make this
real easy for you.</i>

626
00:39:36,715 --> 00:39:39,683
I'm taking Gary
to a party.

627
00:39:39,785 --> 00:39:41,650
Over my dead body.

628
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,745
He's a good kid.

629
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:45,951
He studies hard.

630
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:48,756
If anybody
should be bitching,

631
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:50,763
it should be Gary.

632
00:39:50,831 --> 00:39:54,098
<i>You ever compliment him
on his grades?</i>

633
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,603
Or on anything?

634
00:39:55,671 --> 00:39:57,263
Hey! Hey!

635
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,967
Compliments
embarrass me.

636
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:00,599
Shut up!
Shut up!

637
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:08,075
It's so sad that your son's
only sexual outlet

638
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:11,487
is tossing off to magazines
in the bathroom.

639
00:40:11,558 --> 00:40:13,389
Oh, Gary!

640
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,394
I never tossed off!

641
00:40:15,462 --> 00:40:18,955
<i>You said you were
combing your hair.!</i>

642
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,262
I was!

643
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,236
Gary, shut up!

644
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:24,101
Water's running
all day.

645
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,605
Shut up!

646
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:28,201
I never tossed off!

647
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:31,214
And you wouldn't tell
your own mother!

648
00:40:31,282 --> 00:40:34,250
Shut up!

649
00:40:35,754 --> 00:40:39,248
This guy
deserves a party.

650
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,521
Look, I don't know
who you are,

651
00:40:42,628 --> 00:40:46,066
what you are,
or where you came from,

652
00:40:46,134 --> 00:40:50,070
but I'm not taking
any more of this.

653
00:40:50,138 --> 00:40:53,871
Dial the police, Lucy,
and give me the phone.

654
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:58,142
I'm going to get the...

655
00:40:58,214 --> 00:41:00,148
Give me the phone.

656
00:41:00,216 --> 00:41:02,152
Well, here it is.

657
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,792
Jesus, God.

658
00:41:09,896 --> 00:41:11,797
<i>Oh, Christ.</i>

659
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:14,427
<i>Oh, Lord God.</i>

660
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:18,532
Oh.

661
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,074
Whoa.

662
00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:22,771
Go ahead...

663
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:24,710
make your day?

664
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:33,553
I'm sorry it has to
come to this.

665
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,253
Come to what?

666
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:39,322
Cheer up, or I'll
blow your face off.

667
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:52,882
Don't be
such an old lady.

668
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,747
Everything's cool.

669
00:41:54,818 --> 00:41:56,252
Everything's cool!

670
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:59,050
My dad's going to
castrate me.

671
00:41:59,123 --> 00:42:01,992
My mother almost had
a cardiac arrest.

672
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,997
I'll be grounded
till I'm 45.

673
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,965
Other than that,
everything's great.

674
00:42:08,034 --> 00:42:10,004
Couldn't be better.

675
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:13,064
Trust me for once,
will you?

676
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:16,543
They don't know
what happened.

677
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:20,516
Did you think

678
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:24,543
Gary was acting a little
strangely this evening?

679
00:42:25,856 --> 00:42:27,324
Gary?

680
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:30,061
Who's Gary?

681
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:38,971
Lisa, promise me things
won't get out of control.

682
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,473
Don't worry.

683
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:43,979
You're just having
a few friends over.

684
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:46,480
I don't have
any friends.

685
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:48,017
He doesn't.

686
00:42:49,252 --> 00:42:51,221
Boy ain't lying.

687
00:42:52,924 --> 00:42:54,915
You do now.

688
00:43:03,303 --> 00:43:04,737
Hi.

689
00:43:04,805 --> 00:43:07,273
Hi! Hi! Hi!

690
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:08,434
<i>Party.!</i>

691
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:15,847
<i>Party.! Party.! Party.!</i>

692
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:18,410
<i>Standin' here
by the window</i>

693
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:21,084
<i>Starin' out
at the night</i>

694
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:23,650
<i>Gotta save me
from troubles...</i>

695
00:43:26,232 --> 00:43:28,632
<i>Oh, baby</i>

696
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:31,034
<i>It's gonna work out fine</i>

697
00:43:31,104 --> 00:43:34,074
<i>You heard the sound
of footsteps</i>

698
00:43:34,142 --> 00:43:37,202
<i>Swinging across the floor...</i>

699
00:43:39,481 --> 00:43:40,641
Ho!

700
00:43:40,716 --> 00:43:44,653
How you doing?

701
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:45,881
Where's the bar?

702
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:47,218
Bar!

703
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:52,664
Do you think they'll
embarrass us tonight?

704
00:43:52,732 --> 00:43:55,690
Yeah.

705
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:02,640
Caviar?

706
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:05,611
If Max and Ian
see her,

707
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,979
it's over for us.

708
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,110
How's your stomach?

709
00:44:10,187 --> 00:44:11,414
Better.

710
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:15,424
If you're gonna float an
air biscuit, let me know.

711
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:17,120
Float a what?

712
00:44:17,195 --> 00:44:20,324
If you fart,
I'll hit the fan.

713
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:23,334
Sorry. I suffer
pain and discomfort

714
00:44:23,402 --> 00:44:26,396
due to occasional
stomach upset.

715
00:44:26,473 --> 00:44:30,375
We always talk about
how great it would be

716
00:44:30,444 --> 00:44:32,878
if we went to parties.

717
00:44:32,948 --> 00:44:36,908
Now it's our party, hundreds
of people are having fun,

718
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:39,146
and we're in the John.

719
00:44:39,222 --> 00:44:42,158
You're as uptight
as I am.

720
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:45,162
Nobody can be
as uptight as you.

721
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,664
Your middle name
is tense...

722
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:49,666
Wyatt "Tense Up"
Donnely.

723
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:51,669
It's not that bad.

724
00:44:51,738 --> 00:44:54,173
We can hear the music.

725
00:44:54,242 --> 00:44:58,177
Maybe if we put
our noses to the door,

726
00:44:58,245 --> 00:45:00,579
we can smell the food.

727
00:45:00,649 --> 00:45:02,082
Hey, brother!

728
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,584
What's happening,
my main man?

729
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:06,086
Right on!

730
00:45:06,154 --> 00:45:07,213
Scotch.

731
00:45:07,323 --> 00:45:08,585
Straight up?

732
00:45:08,658 --> 00:45:10,957
Give me
the whole bottle.

733
00:45:11,028 --> 00:45:12,461
Bend over.

734
00:45:12,529 --> 00:45:15,897
I'll shove it
straight up your ass.

735
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:18,562
On the rocks is fine.

736
00:45:18,638 --> 00:45:20,300
Ha ha ha ha!

737
00:45:20,374 --> 00:45:24,208
Yeah, that's what
I thought you'd say.

738
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:39,285
There she is.

739
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,955
You deal
with the drinks.

740
00:45:41,065 --> 00:45:43,034
<i>I'll kill the girls.</i>

741
00:45:54,549 --> 00:45:57,483
I wonder
if Lisa's having fun.

742
00:45:57,551 --> 00:46:01,819
Lisa could have fun at
an insurance seminar, Wyatt.

743
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:04,793
The thing
that really galls me

744
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:06,795
is that she's ours

745
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:10,267
and we can't
get close to her.

746
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,337
Hit the fan.

747
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:19,735
This is the best party
I've ever been to.

748
00:46:19,814 --> 00:46:21,247
It's great!

749
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:23,248
Whose house is this?

750
00:46:23,316 --> 00:46:27,254
It's probably that girl
with the English accent.

751
00:46:27,322 --> 00:46:31,259
She doesn't have a zit
on her whole body.

752
00:46:31,327 --> 00:46:33,261
She has zero fat.

753
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:35,264
And she's so relaxed.

754
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:37,961
She burped
and it was charming.

755
00:46:42,207 --> 00:46:43,641
Uh, yeah.

756
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:45,200
The bathroom.

757
00:46:51,419 --> 00:46:52,852
Ladies.

758
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,354
Hi.
Hi.

759
00:46:54,423 --> 00:46:55,685
Hi.

760
00:46:55,758 --> 00:46:57,350
<i>I can't believe you.!</i>

761
00:46:57,427 --> 00:46:59,360
<i>You're dropping
wolfbait</i>

762
00:46:59,428 --> 00:47:01,294
<i>and chicks are outside.!</i>

763
00:47:01,364 --> 00:47:04,357
Light a match!
Light a fire!

764
00:47:06,371 --> 00:47:08,305
Hi.
Hi.

765
00:47:08,373 --> 00:47:09,806
Hi.

766
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:13,778
We thought there were
just girls in there.

767
00:47:13,846 --> 00:47:15,939
It's just us dudes.

768
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:17,779
Why are you here?

769
00:47:17,885 --> 00:47:21,014
Gary was just
taking a shit.

770
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:22,488
I meant...

771
00:47:23,959 --> 00:47:27,418
What are you doing
at the party?

772
00:47:27,531 --> 00:47:29,465
Oh, it's my house.

773
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:31,468
This is your party?

774
00:47:31,536 --> 00:47:35,472
We like to do this
once a week,

775
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,475
throw little
get-togethers.

776
00:47:37,543 --> 00:47:39,636
Haven't you guys
been by?

777
00:47:39,711 --> 00:47:42,476
How did we
miss these two?

778
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:45,485
So many people,
so many parties.

779
00:47:45,553 --> 00:47:47,111
So many parties.

780
00:47:47,188 --> 00:47:48,520
You lose track.

781
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,356
Can I come in
and check my face?

782
00:47:52,427 --> 00:47:54,396
What's wrong with it?

783
00:47:54,464 --> 00:47:57,093
Can we come in?

784
00:47:57,201 --> 00:47:58,896
Come on in.

785
00:47:58,969 --> 00:48:00,834
Sure. Be our guests.

786
00:48:00,904 --> 00:48:02,395
Thanks, guys.

787
00:48:04,409 --> 00:48:06,844
We've seen you
at school,

788
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:08,846
but we've never met.

789
00:48:08,914 --> 00:48:10,348
You're Hilly.

790
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:11,850
You're Deb.

791
00:48:11,918 --> 00:48:13,852
Hi. I'm Gary.

792
00:48:13,921 --> 00:48:15,354
Hi, Gary.

793
00:48:15,423 --> 00:48:18,359
What have you guys
been doing...

794
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:22,329
I didn't know you guys
had so many friends.

795
00:48:22,398 --> 00:48:24,161
Neither did we.

796
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,033
Who's the girl
with the accent?

797
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,902
I thought
this was her party.

798
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:33,467
You mean the sensuous
sex symbol type?

799
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:35,011
Yeah.
Yeah.

800
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,015
<i>She's with us.</i>

801
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:40,247
She's with... you guys?

802
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,789
Come on, Lisa.
Why not?

803
00:48:42,857 --> 00:48:45,792
Because I belong
to Gary and Wyatt.

804
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,799
Did they make you in the
garage with power tools?

805
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:52,926
Do they own you?

806
00:48:53,003 --> 00:48:54,402
<i>Control you?</i>

807
00:48:54,471 --> 00:48:55,904
<i>Seriously.</i>

808
00:48:55,972 --> 00:48:57,167
Seriously.

809
00:48:57,241 --> 00:48:58,708
They're toads.

810
00:48:58,744 --> 00:49:03,511
Do I look like
I'd go out with two toads?

811
00:49:03,615 --> 00:49:04,913
<i>You do.</i>

812
00:49:05,018 --> 00:49:06,952
Gary and Wyatt

813
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,457
will force everyone
to redefine their terms.

814
00:49:10,524 --> 00:49:13,653
And you're completely
loyal to them?

815
00:49:13,728 --> 00:49:18,030
I do whatever they say.

816
00:49:28,846 --> 00:49:30,336
Hi.

817
00:49:32,518 --> 00:49:36,979
Could you excuse us
for a minute, please?

818
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:40,516
No problem.
We'll be in here.

819
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:51,063
Okay, fine.

820
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:56,513
They're stoked
for us.

821
00:49:56,581 --> 00:49:59,016
Should we go for it?

822
00:49:59,085 --> 00:50:00,951
What about Lisa?

823
00:50:01,021 --> 00:50:02,988
She said we should party.

824
00:50:03,055 --> 00:50:05,786
Let's score points
with these two.

825
00:50:05,859 --> 00:50:08,728
We'll deal with
the mechanics later.

826
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:10,025
Sounds good.

827
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,531
Let's not hurt
Lisa's feelings.

828
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,432
She wants
a bone job from me.

829
00:50:14,503 --> 00:50:17,338
Ready to party?
Let's break!

830
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,658
Those guys are weird,
but they're kinda cute.

831
00:50:32,726 --> 00:50:34,126
Hi.

832
00:50:34,195 --> 00:50:37,130
Where did you two
disappear to?

833
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:40,929
We were in the bathroom.
We were in the kitchen.

834
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,938
Eating.
Doing our hair.

835
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,975
Have you met
Gary and Wyatt?

836
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,476
Yes.
No.

837
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,943
Sort of.

838
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:54,318
If you get the chance,
shower with them.

839
00:50:54,386 --> 00:50:55,819
I did.

840
00:50:55,888 --> 00:50:58,357
It's a mind scrambler!

841
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:01,259
Oh, hurts so good.

842
00:51:05,766 --> 00:51:08,760
She took a shower
with them.

843
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:11,773
I have a wonderful
idea, Henry.

844
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:15,676
After dinner, let's
stop by and visit Wyatt.

845
00:51:15,746 --> 00:51:18,215
He's alone
at home tonight.

846
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:21,219
Doesn't he have
anything to read?

847
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:23,220
I don't know, dear,

848
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:27,226
but nothing's more
important to a teenage boy

849
00:51:27,294 --> 00:51:29,159
than his grandparents.

850
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:31,060
We'll drop by.

851
00:51:37,606 --> 00:51:40,599
Ha ha ha!
Yeah! Woo!

852
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:50,650
I'd like to apologize
for the Ice today at the mall.

853
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:53,692
It was very immature.
I'm sorry.

854
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,854
It was just,
like, tomfoolery.

855
00:51:56,929 --> 00:51:59,195
<i>We are sorry.</i>

856
00:51:59,267 --> 00:52:01,326
It happened.

857
00:52:01,403 --> 00:52:03,702
What's the deal
with Lisa?

858
00:52:03,773 --> 00:52:05,399
Can we borrow her?

859
00:52:05,473 --> 00:52:07,909
We can't do that, guys.

860
00:52:07,978 --> 00:52:09,912
Common decency
prohibits us.

861
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,245
We can't.
It's not cool.

862
00:52:12,316 --> 00:52:15,217
Well, she said
it was cool.

863
00:52:15,286 --> 00:52:18,745
We can't take advantage
of her loyalties.

864
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:20,987
That's really
selfish.

865
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,027
Just forget it, guys.

866
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:25,623
We can't do it,
you know?

867
00:52:25,733 --> 00:52:28,258
Come on.
Quit being pricks.

868
00:52:28,335 --> 00:52:30,201
Hey, come on.

869
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:34,209
<i>Regardless of what
she may have told you,</i>

870
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:37,736
our feelings for Lisa
run very deep.

871
00:52:37,815 --> 00:52:40,716
So do ours
for Deb and Hilly.

872
00:52:40,784 --> 00:52:44,221
It's respect, the time
you spent together.

873
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,349
You guys deserve them.

874
00:52:46,425 --> 00:52:49,826
<i>We want to make
a deal with you.</i>

875
00:52:49,895 --> 00:52:52,888
Let us have
a crack at Lisa

876
00:52:52,966 --> 00:52:55,800
and Deb and Hilly
are yours.

877
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,863
Can you guys
keep a secret?

878
00:52:58,974 --> 00:53:00,100
Sure.

879
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:01,471
A secret?

880
00:53:01,543 --> 00:53:03,478
Look again.
It's Gary.

881
00:53:03,546 --> 00:53:04,979
No, no.

882
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,777
It's our boy, Gary.

883
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,786
He's our
16-year-old boy.

884
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,846
I don't know

885
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:15,155
what the hell you're
talking about, Lucy.

886
00:53:15,228 --> 00:53:17,253
I feel
like an asshole.

887
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,059
This had better work.

888
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:21,327
This is just
the blueprint.

889
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:23,336
You like it?

890
00:53:23,404 --> 00:53:25,372
Bigger tits.
Bigger tits.

891
00:53:25,406 --> 00:53:27,465
Go, go, go, go!

892
00:53:27,575 --> 00:53:29,373
<i>Give him
the knee shooters.</i>

893
00:53:30,713 --> 00:53:34,081
<i>What the hell's
going on here?</i>

894
00:53:38,589 --> 00:53:40,455
Excuse me, Arthur.

895
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:41,959
It's Art.

896
00:53:42,027 --> 00:53:44,018
Excuse me, Art.

897
00:53:58,415 --> 00:54:00,006
Oh, shit.

898
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:04,053
Aah!

899
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:07,390
<i>Weird</i>

904
00:54:28,651 --> 00:54:30,414
Oh!

00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:32,479
Oh! Oh! Oh!

906
00:54:38,029 --> 00:54:39,964
What's going on?

907
00:54:40,032 --> 00:54:41,967
Turn this thing off!

908
00:54:42,035 --> 00:54:43,661
You'll love it!

909
00:54:43,736 --> 00:54:46,205

It worked.

925
00:56:23,661 --> 00:56:27,598
You had to be big shots,
didn't you?

926
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:30,133
You had to show off.

927
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:34,139
People will like you
for what you are,

928
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:37,143
not for what
you can give them.

929

<i>In your race
for power and glory,</i>

930
00:56:40,215 --> 00:56:43,651
you forgot
one small detail.

931
00:56:43,718 --> 00:56:46,347
We forgot to
hook up the doll.

932
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:49,984
You forgot to
hook up the doll.

933
00:57:31,444 --> 00:57:33,878
Something's going on here, Carmen.

934
00:57:33,947 --> 00:57:37,907
I have a feeling
we won't approve, Henry.

935
00:57:37,985 --> 00:57:41,379
A missile!

936
00:57:41,456 --> 00:57:44,449
A missile
in my house, Gary!

937
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:48,564
This puppy's
for real, all right.

938
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:50,361
It was an accident.

939
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:51,800
It happens...

940
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,838
Accident my ass, Gary!

941
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:57,137
My parents and Chet
will freak out!

942
00:57:57,243 --> 00:57:59,609
They'll shit egg rolls.

943
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:01,113
Get out!

944
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:03,115
Get out! Scat!

945
00:58:03,183 --> 00:58:05,119
Out! Disgusting tramps!

946
00:58:05,187 --> 00:58:07,154
You, you, you...
hosers!

947
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:08,918
Out! Out!

948
00:58:08,991 --> 00:58:10,424
Stop that!

949
00:58:10,492 --> 00:58:13,429
You shouldn't walk
into somebody's house

950
00:58:13,497 --> 00:58:16,124
and hit people
with your hat.

951
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:18,134
This is
my daughter's home.

952
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:19,760
Who are you?

953
00:58:19,837 --> 00:58:24,332
I'm a close personal
friend of your grandson's.

954
00:58:24,443 --> 00:58:26,412
Henry,
call the police.

955
00:58:26,479 --> 00:58:28,640
I'll have you
incarcerated.

956
00:58:28,748 --> 00:58:30,547
Here's the deal...

957
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:34,988
Gary and Wyatt... they
created me on their computer.

958
00:58:35,056 --> 00:58:38,994
I'm not going to listen
to this baloney.

959
00:58:39,062 --> 00:58:41,962
He doesn't stand
for baloney.

960
00:58:42,031 --> 00:58:43,897
Do you mind waiting?

961
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:46,458
I won't be a moment.

962
00:58:47,973 --> 00:58:49,906
Have you ever?

963
00:58:49,974 --> 00:58:51,465
Never.

964
00:58:52,978 --> 00:58:56,381
Wyatt, your grandparents are downstairs.

965
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,940
Okay. Thanks, Lis.

966
00:59:02,356 --> 00:59:03,881
Lisa!

967
00:59:03,992 --> 00:59:05,426
Yes?

968
00:59:05,495 --> 00:59:07,428
Where are
my grandparents?

969
00:59:07,496 --> 00:59:09,431
Your kitchen
is blue.

970
00:59:09,499 --> 00:59:11,433
Want to try one?

971
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:13,437
Where are
my grandparents?

972
00:59:13,505 --> 00:59:15,995
They're all
taken care of.

973
00:59:20,512 --> 00:59:23,506
You're going to
love this one.

974
00:59:28,488 --> 00:59:30,355
Are they all right?

975
00:59:30,426 --> 00:59:31,859
They're fine.

976
00:59:31,961 --> 00:59:33,861
They're
better than fine.

977
00:59:33,963 --> 00:59:36,295
They're not aging
anymore.

978
00:59:37,466 --> 00:59:40,437
<i>See? They're smiling.</i>

979
00:59:40,504 --> 00:59:44,531
If any more of his relatives drop by,

980
00:59:44,608 --> 00:59:47,579
we'll be upstairs
in the bathroom.

981
00:59:49,115 --> 00:59:53,051
Those guys really need
some self-confidence,

982
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,815
a challenge...

983
00:59:54,888 --> 00:59:56,550
<i>Something that'll bring out</i>

984
00:59:56,624 --> 00:59:58,922
<i>their inner strength
and courage.</i>

985
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:05,558
I'm so bloody clever.

986
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:10,500
Now!

987
01:00:34,605 --> 01:00:36,094
Aaah!

988
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:40,601
Aaah!
Aaah!

989
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:46,579
Arrggghhh!

990
01:00:46,653 --> 01:00:49,121
Ha ha ha ha!

991
01:00:58,868 --> 01:01:00,859
This Bud's for you.

992
01:01:02,771 --> 01:01:04,365
Arrggghhh!

993
01:01:07,379 --> 01:01:09,313
This party's lame, Max.

994
01:01:09,381 --> 01:01:11,372
What about the girls?

995
01:01:12,985 --> 01:01:14,475
Girls, shmirls.

996
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:20,691
Aaah!

997
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:24,191
Aaah!

998
01:01:35,646 --> 01:01:37,080
<i>Lisa.!</i>

999
01:01:37,149 --> 01:01:39,140
What's going on?

1000
01:01:40,385 --> 01:01:41,785
Aaah!

1001
01:01:46,727 --> 01:01:49,788
Arrggghhh!

1002
01:01:49,898 --> 01:01:50,796
Aaah!

1003
01:01:50,866 --> 01:01:52,424
Oh!

1004
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:56,638
Oh!

1005
01:01:59,676 --> 01:02:01,109
Gary!

1006
01:02:01,178 --> 01:02:03,613
Gary, listen to me.

1007
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:06,616
There are motorcycles
in my house!

1008
01:02:06,684 --> 01:02:10,678
There are killer mutants
in your house, okay?

1009
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:32,644
Screw the house.
Screw the house.

1010
01:02:54,612 --> 01:03:00,812
Aaaaahhhh!

1011
01:03:06,693 --> 01:03:09,685
Ha ha ha ha!

1012
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:13,632
Guys, you have
uninvited guests.

1013
01:03:13,701 --> 01:03:15,636
Ask them to leave.

1014
01:03:15,704 --> 01:03:18,400
They're getting
pretty rowdy.

1015
01:03:18,473 --> 01:03:20,340
Ha ha ha ha!

1016
01:03:23,814 --> 01:03:25,805
This is
an excellent chance

1017
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:29,251
for you to prove your
bravery and courage.

1018
01:03:29,321 --> 01:03:31,379
Those are outdated concepts.

1019
01:03:31,489 --> 01:03:34,357
Don't let John Wayne
hear you say that.

1020
01:03:34,426 --> 01:03:36,225
The man is dead!

1021
01:03:36,297 --> 01:03:41,291
So are you if you don't
deal with this situation.

1022
01:03:42,803 --> 01:03:44,796
No, thanks.
No, thanks.

1023
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:50,176
Gary, do you feel
like a chicken?

1024
01:03:50,246 --> 01:03:55,709
If I could shoot an
egg out my ass, I would.

1025
01:03:55,787 --> 01:04:00,224
Will all these people
think we're cowards?

1026
01:04:00,325 --> 01:04:02,227
I don't know.

1027
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:04,729
We can deal with shame.

1028
01:04:04,831 --> 01:04:07,766
Death is
a much deeper issue.

1029
01:04:07,834 --> 01:04:08,994
Aah!

1030
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,000
Aah!

1031
01:04:17,346 --> 01:04:20,112
Grrr.

1032
01:04:31,865 --> 01:04:34,731
We'll get you guys
some drinks.

1033
01:04:34,801 --> 01:04:37,738
You look like
a scotch man.

1034
01:04:37,806 --> 01:04:39,137
Arrggghhh!

1035
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:43,337
Is this your party?

1036
01:04:43,411 --> 01:04:45,347
Uh... well, kind of.

1037
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:50,011
I don't know if
you can call it a party.

1038
01:04:50,087 --> 01:04:52,990
It's, um,
just a few friends.

1039
01:04:53,058 --> 01:04:59,361
How come two unpopular dicks like you

1040
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:01,993
is having a party?

1041
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:03,536
<i>I don't know.</i>

1042
01:05:03,604 --> 01:05:06,836
Dicks sometimes do
the weirdest things.

1043
01:05:06,942 --> 01:05:08,841
I don't know.

1044
01:05:08,943 --> 01:05:13,883
How would you like
all your friends here

1045
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:18,889
to know that you wear
a bra on your heads?

1046
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:24,692
Ha ha ha ha!

1047
01:05:24,764 --> 01:05:25,957
Ha ha!

1048
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:29,798
Tossed off into any good
books lately, have we?

1049
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:32,396
Ha ha ha ha!

1050
01:05:33,874 --> 01:05:39,338
You two can't even
take a shower

1051
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:41,475
with a beautiful woman

1052
01:05:41,551 --> 01:05:45,352
without wearing
your jeans!

1053
01:05:45,423 --> 01:05:52,763
Ha ha ha ha!

1054
01:05:52,832 --> 01:05:54,424
You!

1055
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:57,092
Come here!

1056
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,136
Now!

1057
01:06:01,209 --> 01:06:02,938
Grrr.

1058
01:06:06,015 --> 01:06:07,346
Yah!

1059
01:06:07,416 --> 01:06:08,814
Ha ha ha ha!

1060
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:11,911
Aah!

1061
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:16,483
Oh!

1062
01:06:16,561 --> 01:06:17,858
Haaa!

1063
01:06:17,962 --> 01:06:20,397
Prepare to die,
Wyatt.

1064
01:06:20,466 --> 01:06:22,901
I can't wait to die.

1065
01:06:22,969 --> 01:06:24,732
We're gonna kick...

1066
01:06:24,804 --> 01:06:25,862
ass.

1067
01:06:25,973 --> 01:06:28,942
Okay. This is war.

1068
01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:30,500
<i>Hands off the girls.</i>

1069
01:06:30,579 --> 01:06:33,446
Leave the girls
out of this.

1070
01:06:33,515 --> 01:06:35,108
Ha ha ha ha!

1071
01:06:35,184 --> 01:06:37,311
I said hands off!

1072
01:06:37,386 --> 01:06:38,546
<i>Now.!</i>

1073
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:40,817
Ah... ahh!

1074
01:06:40,891 --> 01:06:47,466
Hee hee hee hee!

1075
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,025
Why don't you
shut up, bitch?

1076
01:06:54,808 --> 01:06:57,744
And as for
your ugly ass,

1077
01:06:57,812 --> 01:07:00,977
<i>you don't come into
my friend's house</i>

1078
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,983
with your faggot friends,

1079
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:06,488
driving your motorbikes
all over his floors,

1080
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:10,550
stinking up the place...
and you do stink.

1081
01:07:13,832 --> 01:07:18,134
You're going to
let go of the girls

1082
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:20,968
and apologize
to all these people.

1083
01:07:21,073 --> 01:07:22,974
Get on your bikes.

1084
01:07:23,076 --> 01:07:26,103
Pedal your ugly asses
out of here.

1085
01:07:26,215 --> 01:07:28,444
Ha ha ha ha!

1086
01:07:28,516 --> 01:07:32,886
We're gentlemen,
so we'll give you a choice.

1087
01:07:32,955 --> 01:07:35,653
You can
leave in peace...

1088
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:42,523
or you can stay and die.

1089
01:07:44,404 --> 01:07:45,665
Ugh!

1090
01:07:53,882 --> 01:07:55,873
The choice is yours.

1091
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:31,149
Aaaahhhhh!

1092
01:08:34,164 --> 01:08:36,133
Get out of here.

1093
01:08:41,539 --> 01:08:45,102
Beg your pardon.
Your home is lovely.

1094
01:08:45,178 --> 01:08:46,771
<i>Terribly sorry.</i>

1095
01:08:46,848 --> 01:08:49,372
Call me.
We'll have lunch.

1096
01:08:49,449 --> 01:08:52,113
Can we keep this
between us?

1097
01:08:52,187 --> 01:08:55,645
I'd hate to lose
my teaching job.

1098
01:09:00,698 --> 01:09:02,666
God bless you.

1099
01:09:12,713 --> 01:09:14,646
I can't believe it.

1100
01:09:14,714 --> 01:09:16,649
Is everyone all right?

1101
01:09:16,717 --> 01:09:18,151
We're heroes.

1102
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:20,654
We showed
these guys down.

1103
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:24,158
You and me saved
all these people.

1104
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:28,129
<i>This could mean a guest
shot on Phil Donahue.</i>

1105
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:29,962
This is exciting, man!

1106
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:33,003
Where did you
get that thing?

1107
01:09:33,037 --> 01:09:35,598
It's a squirt gun.

1108
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:37,301
Aah!

1109
01:09:45,419 --> 01:09:47,411
That's my boys.

1110
01:09:54,531 --> 01:09:57,056
<i>Crimson morning skyline</i>

1111
01:09:57,134 --> 01:09:58,361
<i>Whoa oh</i>

1112
01:09:58,435 --> 01:10:00,836
What a weird night, huh?

1113
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:05,833
You really weren't
afraid of those guys?

1114
01:10:08,381 --> 01:10:10,315
I was scared.

1115
01:10:10,383 --> 01:10:12,852
But what could I do?

1116
01:10:20,396 --> 01:10:23,831
I probably shouldn't
ask too many questions

1117
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,391
about tonight.

1118
01:10:25,469 --> 01:10:26,834
Probably.

1119
01:10:26,904 --> 01:10:30,841
<i>Since this is
a night of weird shit,</i>

1120
01:10:30,909 --> 01:10:33,572
can I ask you
something strange?

1121
01:10:39,219 --> 01:10:41,380
Would you kiss me?

1122
01:10:43,424 --> 01:10:45,222
What about Ian?

1123
01:10:48,931 --> 01:10:50,923
We all make mistakes.

1124
01:10:53,938 --> 01:10:56,436
Okay.

1125
01:10:57,742 --> 01:10:59,938
Where do you want it?

1126
01:11:03,216 --> 01:11:06,380
Can I ask you
a question?

1127
01:11:06,453 --> 01:11:07,852
Yeah.

1128
01:11:07,922 --> 01:11:10,915
How do you feel
about Lisa?

1129
01:11:10,992 --> 01:11:13,654
I love her.

1130
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:15,890
That's what I figured.

1131
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,335
But, uh...

1132
01:11:19,403 --> 01:11:22,839
it's definitely a
different kind of love.

1133
01:11:22,906 --> 01:11:26,343
You know,
it's more sisterly,

1134
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:29,848
like big sisters,
like, kind of.

1135
01:11:29,949 --> 01:11:31,849
But she's
so beautiful.

1136
01:11:35,355 --> 01:11:38,655
Yeah, she's
really beautiful.

1137
01:11:38,726 --> 01:11:43,221
And her body is...
it's gorgeous.

1138
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:46,666
It's a nice figure.

1139
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:48,328
So...

1140
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,369
I mean, what would I be compared to her?

1141
01:11:54,479 --> 01:12:00,885
Deb, Lisa is everything
I ever wanted in a girl...

1142
01:12:02,389 --> 01:12:05,324
before I knew
what I wanted.

1143
01:12:05,392 --> 01:12:09,329
<i>I know that if
I could do it again,</i>

1144
01:12:09,397 --> 01:12:12,390
I'd make her
just like you.

1145
01:12:14,203 --> 01:12:15,866
Honest.

1146
01:12:24,417 --> 01:12:25,850
Dead honest.

1147
01:12:25,919 --> 01:12:29,878
I'm like... I'm really honest
when I say that.

1148
01:12:29,989 --> 01:12:31,286
I'm so very honest.

1149
01:12:31,358 --> 01:12:33,350
<i>I mean that.</i>

1150
01:13:23,789 --> 01:13:26,384
What the hell?

1151
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,189
<i>Ucch.!</i>

1152
01:13:28,261 --> 01:13:30,252
That little bastard.

1153
01:13:32,468 --> 01:13:36,132
If my room's okay,
I won't kill him.

1154
01:13:36,206 --> 01:13:39,664
I'll just hurt him
real bad.

1155
01:14:09,247 --> 01:14:10,714
Freeze.

1156
01:14:12,015 --> 01:14:13,449
Chet!

1157
01:14:13,518 --> 01:14:15,487
Where's my brother?

1158
01:14:16,488 --> 01:14:18,684
Ow.

1159
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:20,191
Uh...

1160
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,490
I don't know.

1161
01:14:22,562 --> 01:14:24,554
You're dead meat,
pilgrim.

1162
01:14:26,668 --> 01:14:28,135
Uh...

1163
01:14:28,203 --> 01:14:30,763
Chet, Chet,
that's her nose.

1164
01:14:30,839 --> 01:14:34,037
She has nothing
to do with it.

1165
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:35,840
Okay. You die.

1166
01:14:35,946 --> 01:14:40,280
She walks out of here
with a severe limp.

1167
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,952
I'll be back.

1168
01:14:55,069 --> 01:14:57,401
That's Wyatt's
older brother, Chet.

1169
01:14:57,472 --> 01:14:59,304
He's an asshole.

1170
01:15:02,078 --> 01:15:03,807
Oh, hi, Chet.

1171
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,317
What the hell's
going on around here?

1172
01:15:07,384 --> 01:15:09,819
Chet, it was
an accident.

1173
01:15:09,888 --> 01:15:11,355
An accident?

1174
01:15:11,389 --> 01:15:15,258
Do you realize
it's snowing in my room,

1175
01:15:15,328 --> 01:15:16,727
goddamn it?

1176
01:15:16,796 --> 01:15:19,357
<i>Some weird shit
happened, Chet.</i>

1177
01:15:19,433 --> 01:15:23,370
It doesn't take a genius
to figure that out,

1178
01:15:23,438 --> 01:15:24,871
monkey dick.

1179
01:15:24,939 --> 01:15:26,373
Start talking.

1180
01:15:26,442 --> 01:15:30,539
Gary and I made a
woman with the computer.

1181
01:15:30,614 --> 01:15:34,449
She went crazy and
messed up the house.

1182
01:15:34,519 --> 01:15:37,420
Don't smart-mouth me,
you shit!

1183
01:15:37,488 --> 01:15:39,286
Leave him alone.

1184
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,552
This is a family
matter, bimbo.

1185
01:15:41,627 --> 01:15:44,290
Chet, just let me
find Lisa.

1186
01:15:44,397 --> 01:15:46,297
She'll clear
everything up.

1187
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:49,096
You can have
my college money

1188
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:53,403
and my social security,
Chet.

1189
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:02,345
So you guys think
you can fool me, huh?

1190
01:16:02,419 --> 01:16:04,012
Huh?

1191
01:16:04,088 --> 01:16:07,854
You've synched everybody
to the same bullshit story.

1192
01:16:07,926 --> 01:16:11,419
This is
a Pershing missile, Chip.

1193
01:16:11,497 --> 01:16:13,523
My name is Chet.

1194
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:19,870
And I didn't think
it was a whale's dick, honey.

1195
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,015
Hi, Nanny.
Hi, Grampy.

1196
01:16:28,117 --> 01:16:30,382
I'm not a moron.

1197
01:16:30,454 --> 01:16:31,888
I...

1198
01:16:33,892 --> 01:16:35,883
Was that
my grandparents?

1199
01:16:41,068 --> 01:16:43,002
Are they dead?

1200
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:45,265
No. They're
just resting.

1201
01:16:45,339 --> 01:16:48,309
What are they
doing in here?

1202
01:16:48,343 --> 01:16:50,812
<i>I put them in there.</i>

1203
01:16:50,879 --> 01:16:55,943
<i>They weren't having a very
good time at the party.</i>

1204
01:16:56,052 --> 01:16:59,989
<i>Do you think
they're having a good time</i>

1205
01:17:00,057 --> 01:17:02,582
catatonic in a closet?

1206
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:09,231
Do you have any idea
how disrespectful that is?

1207
01:17:09,302 --> 01:17:12,500
I wouldn't give
a squirt of piss

1208
01:17:12,573 --> 01:17:15,042
for your ass right now.

1209
01:17:19,547 --> 01:17:22,609
<i>You guys
get the girls home.</i>

1210
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,779
<i>Wyatt,
take the Porsche.</i>

1211
01:17:24,889 --> 01:17:26,981
Gary, take the Ferrari.

1212
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:28,421
The Ferrari?

1213
01:17:28,492 --> 01:17:31,520
I want to be alone
with Chet.

1214
01:17:31,597 --> 01:17:33,463
Good to see you.

1215
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:35,466
Get out of here!

1216
01:17:35,534 --> 01:17:38,026
Take your little
hussies home!

1217
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:44,375
I want to get to
the bottom of this,

1218
01:17:44,445 --> 01:17:46,141
A.S.A.F.P.

1219
01:17:46,214 --> 01:17:48,376
Oh, so do I.

1220
01:17:50,521 --> 01:17:54,183
First, I'd like to
butter your muffin.

1221
01:17:54,257 --> 01:17:56,351
Why must you be
such a wanker?

1222
01:17:56,427 --> 01:17:59,956
Because
I get off on it.

1223
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:02,796
I want you to
keep your big mouth shut

1224
01:18:02,868 --> 01:18:05,531
about everything
that's happened here.

1225
01:18:05,605 --> 01:18:09,336
Treat Wyatt and Gary
with dignity and respect.

1226
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:11,240
Oh, really?

1227
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:13,007
Yeah. Really.

1228
01:18:13,081 --> 01:18:16,519
I can be
a real serious bitch...

1229
01:18:16,586 --> 01:18:20,716
if I don't get
what I want.

1230
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:25,593
Ooh. Hit me
with your best shot.

1231
01:18:30,102 --> 01:18:32,435
How fast
are you going?

1232
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:34,006
About 35.

1233
01:18:45,019 --> 01:18:47,420
Wait.
This can't be right.

1234
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:49,790
<i>Are you looking
at the RPMs?</i>

1235
01:18:49,861 --> 01:18:53,024
No. I'm looking at
about 50 tickets.

1236
01:19:08,216 --> 01:19:09,683
Bye!

1237
01:19:39,855 --> 01:19:42,324
This happens
every time!

1238
01:19:42,425 --> 01:19:44,620
Oh, my. Whew!

1239
01:19:44,694 --> 01:19:46,662
That was great!

1240
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:58,637
You son of a bitch!

1241
01:19:58,712 --> 01:20:01,738
Al, Al!
Al, that was Gary!

1242
01:20:01,816 --> 01:20:04,181
Who is this
Gary character?

1243
01:20:06,188 --> 01:20:09,817
I had a great time
last night.

1244
01:20:09,925 --> 01:20:15,661
I'll probably be grounded
for a month or so, but...

1245
01:20:15,733 --> 01:20:17,701
I'll wait for you.

1246
01:20:20,906 --> 01:20:30,749
<i>Oh</i>

1247
01:20:33,288 --> 01:20:35,654
Mmph!

1248
01:20:35,724 --> 01:20:37,158
Mmm.

1249
01:20:37,226 --> 01:20:45,727
<i>Whoa</i>

1250
01:20:51,277 --> 01:20:53,610
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1251
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,011
Hilly!

1252
01:20:55,883 --> 01:20:57,851
I love you!

1253
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:06,355
All right!

1254
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:14,271
I want to thank you
for a great night.

1255
01:21:14,372 --> 01:21:15,771
Same here.

1256
01:21:15,874 --> 01:21:19,936
I have kind of
a confession to make.

1257
01:21:23,483 --> 01:21:26,043
I'm really
not this cool.

1258
01:21:27,822 --> 01:21:29,916
That's not my car.

1259
01:21:29,992 --> 01:21:32,358
This is not my suit.

1260
01:21:32,428 --> 01:21:35,056
Those people
weren't my friends.

1261
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:38,568
Why are you telling me
all of this?

1262
01:21:38,636 --> 01:21:41,764
Because I want you
to like me

1263
01:21:41,839 --> 01:21:43,306
for what I am.

1264
01:21:43,374 --> 01:21:46,367
Whatever you are,
I like it.

1265
01:22:04,401 --> 01:22:05,835
Whew!

1266
01:22:05,903 --> 01:22:08,837
Well, I'd better
get going.

1267
01:22:08,905 --> 01:22:13,276
Wyatt and I still
have to deal with Chet.

1268
01:22:13,913 --> 01:22:15,311
Quit screwing around!

1269
01:22:15,381 --> 01:22:18,545
This isn't funny,
you stupid bitch!

1270
01:22:18,618 --> 01:22:21,679
Careful, Chet.
Don't make me angry.

1271
01:22:21,789 --> 01:22:23,382
Sorry.

1272
01:22:26,428 --> 01:22:28,328
That's better.

1273
01:22:28,397 --> 01:22:30,867
Turn me back
to normal.

1274
01:22:30,934 --> 01:22:33,800
I haven't done
anything to you.

1275
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:36,806
You've done plenty
to your brother.

1276
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:38,240
Like what?

1277
01:22:38,309 --> 01:22:40,801
You've nagged him,
harassed him...

1278
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,312
Huh, me?

1279
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:46,876
Suppressed him,
extorted money from him.

1280
01:22:46,953 --> 01:22:49,013
It was done
out of love.

1281
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:52,992
I should give you
a set of elephant balls.

1282
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:55,188
Heeagghh!

1283
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:01,837
Promise me you'll leave
Wyatt and Gary alone,

1284
01:23:01,905 --> 01:23:05,001
and I'll change you back.

1285
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,941
Oh, all right.

1286
01:23:07,012 --> 01:23:09,003
Shake on it, huh?

1287
01:23:12,018 --> 01:23:15,455
No, thanks.
I'd rather not.

1288
01:23:15,522 --> 01:23:17,547
Wait!
Where are you going?

1289
01:23:17,624 --> 01:23:20,753
I have to
go and get changed.

1290
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,024
What about me?

1291
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:26,000
The effect
will wear off, okay?

1292
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:39,618
Well?

1293
01:23:40,987 --> 01:23:42,922
I'm in love.

1294
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:44,422
Isn't it great?

1295
01:23:44,491 --> 01:23:45,788
The best.

1296
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:47,590
I'll tell you what.

1297
01:23:47,662 --> 01:23:50,563
Things are
turning around for us.

1298
01:23:50,632 --> 01:23:52,429
<i>I mean it.</i>

1299
01:23:52,501 --> 01:23:54,128
Okay, what about Lisa?

1300
01:23:57,241 --> 01:24:00,234
We'll have
a talk with her.

1301
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:03,813
Think she'll understand?

1302
01:24:03,915 --> 01:24:05,907
I think so.

1303
01:24:06,018 --> 01:24:10,455
I sure as hell wouldn't
want to date you.

1304
01:24:10,523 --> 01:24:13,221
You're not my type.

1305
01:24:19,968 --> 01:24:22,130
<i>Chet?</i>

1306
01:24:22,205 --> 01:24:23,695
Chet?

1307
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:27,132
Hi, dudes!

1308
01:24:31,683 --> 01:24:33,310
I'm sorry, Wyatt,

1309
01:24:33,418 --> 01:24:37,321
for being a shit to you
all these years.

1310
01:24:37,423 --> 01:24:41,520
And gee,
I want you to know that...

1311
01:24:41,628 --> 01:24:43,529
I love you.

1312
01:24:43,598 --> 01:24:45,532
Blech!

1313
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,263
Ha ha ha ha!

1314
01:24:48,337 --> 01:24:50,532
That's nasty, Wyatt.

1315
01:24:50,606 --> 01:24:52,541
That's Chet, Gary.

1316
01:24:55,513 --> 01:24:58,380
Hey, hey.

1317
01:24:58,449 --> 01:24:59,610
Mmm.

1318
01:25:03,355 --> 01:25:05,517
Mmm!

1319
01:25:07,126 --> 01:25:09,095
Oh, my God!

1320
01:25:11,131 --> 01:25:12,531
<i>Lisa?</i>

1321
01:25:12,634 --> 01:25:14,329
In here.

1322
01:25:14,436 --> 01:25:15,869
Lisa.

1323
01:25:15,937 --> 01:25:17,371
<i>Yeah?</i>

1324
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,771
You saw Chet?

1325
01:25:18,841 --> 01:25:20,571
Yes, I did.

1326
01:25:20,644 --> 01:25:22,134
<i>You're
responsible?</i>

1327
01:25:23,714 --> 01:25:25,580
Yes, I am.

1328
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:29,087
Lisa, we can't
have him like that.

1329
01:25:29,154 --> 01:25:31,520
It'd ruin Christmas.

1330
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:34,992
He'll be fine
in half an hour.

1331
01:25:35,061 --> 01:25:36,859
He won't
spoil Christmas.

1332
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:40,560
<i>And he won't bug you
anymore, either.</i>

1333
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:47,668
Um, Lisa, we have to
have a talk with you.

1334
01:25:47,777 --> 01:25:49,938
What's on your mind?

1335
01:25:50,046 --> 01:25:53,779
I really don't know
how to say this.

1336
01:25:53,852 --> 01:25:57,413
You guys found
girlfriends, right?

1337
01:25:57,489 --> 01:25:59,287
<i>Fell in love
with two girls.</i>

1338
01:25:59,358 --> 01:26:02,795
<i>They fell in love
with you.</i>

1339
01:26:02,863 --> 01:26:06,299
That's all I ever
wanted for you.

1340
01:26:06,366 --> 01:26:08,733
You're not hurt?

1341
01:26:09,838 --> 01:26:13,174
Yeah, sure I'm hurt.

1342
01:26:13,242 --> 01:26:15,939
<i>But I wouldn't
change it.</i>

1343
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:18,446
I'm really
just getting off

1344
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:21,245
seeing you guys
straightened out.

1345
01:26:30,797 --> 01:26:32,732
I have to go.

1346
01:26:49,754 --> 01:26:52,052
Oh.

1347
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:54,753
I've had
a wonderful time.

1348
01:27:04,773 --> 01:27:06,262
Lisa.

1349
01:27:08,777 --> 01:27:10,268
Bye.

1350
01:28:28,276 --> 01:28:29,709
Boys?

1351
01:28:29,778 --> 01:28:31,609
We're home!

1352
01:28:36,753 --> 01:28:39,517
Hi, Mr. Donnely.
How are you?

1353
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:41,183
Hi, honey.

1354
01:28:41,259 --> 01:28:42,850
Dad, hi.

1355
01:28:42,926 --> 01:28:44,452
No, no, no.

1356
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:48,364
<i>What did you guys
do this weekend?</i>

1357
01:28:48,434 --> 01:28:49,868
Not much.

1358
01:28:49,936 --> 01:28:51,869
Hung around the house.

1359
01:28:51,937 --> 01:28:55,340
Daddy thought
you might throw a party

1360
01:28:55,409 --> 01:28:57,401
or do something nutty.

1361
01:28:59,148 --> 01:29:00,580
Not us.
Not here.

1362
01:29:00,681 --> 01:29:02,150
No way.
No way.

1363
01:29:24,646 --> 01:29:26,979
Shh, shh, shh.

1364
01:29:46,272 --> 01:29:48,434
<i>Okay.</i>

1365
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:51,944
